            <em>March 2019 - ongoing support</em>
            <p>
                    I was approached by the CEO of WDAT in March of this year to create and design a website for her new business. We discussed her requirements for the website and the company forms she needed for the testing. I wanted to learn more about her business so I could tailor make the website to be unique from other drug and alcohol testing companies so WDAT would stand out. <br>
                    Every step of the way I consulted with my client to make sure she was happy with the designs I then went into creating the site. <br>
                    I was enthused with this project because it was the first project where I didnt have to do any backend development and purely work on the front end. <br>
                    I built the site with Laravel and instead of Bootscrap 4 I used a different responsive front-end framework called Materialize css. I enjoyed implementing Parallex to images on the site, so as the end user scrolls down the page the images move at a different speed. When the website content was added  I used vanilla Javascript to expand for further text information and then was inspired to add other additional design functionalities. <br>
                    Once my client was happy with the finished product I set up the domain name and deployed onto a VPS server via Laravel Forge. From here I was able to install SSL certificates. <br>
                    THe forms were created with HTML5 and bootstrap grid layout, making it easier to focus on each individual section.
