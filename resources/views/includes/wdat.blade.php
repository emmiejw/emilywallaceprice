                <p>
                    I was approached by the CEO of WDAT in March of this year to create and design a website for her new business. We discussed her requirements for the website and the company forms she needed for the testing. I wanted to learn more about her business so I could tailor make the website to be unique from other drug and alcohol testing companies so WDAT would stand out. <b>Every step of the way I consulted with my client to make sure she was happy with the designs I then went into creating the site.</b> 
                </p>
                <p>
                        I was enthused with this project because it was the first project where I didn't have to do any backend development and purely work on the front end.
                        <b> I built the site with Laravel and instead of Bootscrap 4 I used a different responsive front-end framework called Materialize css</b>. I enjoyed implementing Parallex to images on the site, so as the user scrolls down the page the images move at a different speed. When the website content was added  I used vanilla Javascript to expand for further text information and then was inspired to add other additional design functionalities.

                    Once my client was happy with the finished product I set up the domain name and <b>deployed onto a VPS server via Laravel Forge</b> . From here I was able to install SSL certificates. 
                    <b>The forms were created with HTML5 and bootstrap grid layout, making it easier to focus on each individual section</b>.
