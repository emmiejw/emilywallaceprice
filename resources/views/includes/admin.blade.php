                     Due to a change in my health I commenced in a role within the admin team for the community nurses and palliative care team. During this time I developed a reporting system for Senior Management at Associate Director Level, Daily Status Report. This was a spreadsheet, which enabled me to calculate each community nursing teams' capacity each day to take on new patients on top of their routine caseload. This was forecasted by allocating 1 unit to 15 minutes of the staffing working day, e.g. a staff member working 7.5 hrs had a score of 30 units. This would then be done for each patient and how long the visit would take. The team would then be able to work out what capacity they had to take on additional patients. Based on this system to teams would text message or call me every morning giving me an alert of green for good capacity, amber for little capacity and red for no capacity and black if the team needed assistance from another team. From this information I could formulate a Daily Status Alert to senior Management and hospital discharge to see the current state of community nursing. 
                     I also worked with the Patient Systems team to design and set up the first online patient system to be used in the community. Once the system was tailored to the services needs I attended a train the trainer course so I could roll out the training to the community nurses. This was quite a challenge with the majority being 'old school' nurses who preferred paperwork and didn't know how to use notebooks. Once this system was in place for some time I was then able to pull information of what activities were completed to qualify the service with more funding, which was rewarding being able to justify how hard the teams work.
