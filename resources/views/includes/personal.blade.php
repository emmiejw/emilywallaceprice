                    I am a calm problem solver who is used to challenges. I embrace new technologies, which has had a huge positive impact on my personal life. The last year I have been very privileged to now have access to medical technology, which has been life changing and I'm fascinated about the machine learning algorithms behind my intuitive medical device.

                    I've recently started getting involved in the web development meet up scene. I have given a talk to the Soton Women in Web group about diabetes technology, which I am very passionate about. Attending the group has been a real confidence boost in my abilities in preparation of applying for my first job in the industry. I am very proud to have achieved what I have in web development so far along side bringing up my now four year old son.

                    I am an enthusiastic learner who believes that even though it can take time to achieve a goal , the journey is an invaluable experience in understanding and discovering new technologies and styles. I know there is so much more to learn and what was once a daunting prospect I'm now eager to learn more a diversify my skills and knowledge.
