         <em>March 2018 - ongoing support</em>
         <p>
                A good friend of mine is the CEO of a charity called Hypo Hounds, who train pet dogs to alert their type 1 diabetic owners to impending dangerous blood glucose level changes, which these dogs can detect from a minute odour change in the owners scent. I knew the CEO at the time had to manually every 3 months, go through clients' individual blood glucose diary and the alert diary of the dog, which was very time consuming. 
                I approached her and offered to create a  <b>site for clients to log in and record both their blood glucose levels and the dogs' alert all in one place and can be completed there and then making the activity more efficient</b> . Then every 3 months the client could email a report to the CEO. Upon discussion we decided to add a admin panel so she and the trainers could log into the site and  <b>view client records as and when they needed meaning they could provide support to clients a lot quicker and wouldn't need to chase clients when the reports were due</b>.
                This was my first live project that was going to be used in the real world and my focus was to make it user friendly and quick to use. <b>Building the site was one thing but I had to learn about and how to deploy to a server and the relevant SSL certificates, setting up domains and namespaces for the server</b> . 
                I produced <b>user guides for the clients on how to register an account and use the diary system</b> . For the more visual people I created youtube videos as a guide. 
                <b> I was very pleased with my first website and it felt exhilarating to see my work online and even more so when the site became live to the clients.</b>  I've continued to provide support as and when any clients need support.
