                I'm one of the Parent Governors at my sons' pre-school and during a meeting I offered to build them a website. The Manager and I had frequent meet up's to discuss the content and the information that was required. I initially thought the website would be a static website but due to policies, the Manager wanted to have complete control of the content. I created a admin area for the Manager to log on and use the CRUD functionality to keep the site current and up to date. To extend my skills I asked the Manager if she would like a testimonial page for parents to leave comments about the pre-school. She really liked the idea but wanted to be able to authorise the posts before they appear on the site. I was able to create this functionality within the Admin panel and I also set up Laravel Notifications so she would receive an email every time a notification was submitted.
