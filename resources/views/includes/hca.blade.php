         <em>2006 to 2010</em>
         <p>
                  In this role I worked as a health care assistant in a district nursing team. I predominantly worked with leg ulcer care and person care for palliative patients. I found this a very rewarding job and when the teams were provided <b>Blackberry mobiles I helped with training to use them and also worked with the service Manager to create a wound photo declaration/assessment form</b>. This was so staff could take photos of wounds and monitor the changes visually. This became very important when pressure ulcers needed to be <b>reported to the Risk Management to eliminate or address safe guarding issues</b> .
